| ***Talk Abstract (250 words)***
Remember Ethereum’s Mist Browser? It was our Garden of Eden, promising a decentralized paradise, but it sucked—slow syncs, clunky RPCs, and zero privacy. I’m Thomas Jay Rush, and at TrueBlocks, we’re reviving Mist’s cypherpunk dream with tools that yank power from Web2’s prying eyes. Our Ethereum Foundation grant (2024–2025) fuels mini-dApps like trueblocks-browse, running on local nodes for 100x faster, permissionless queries. No APIs, no rate limits—just you and the chain.
Mist failed because it leaned on Geth’s startup sync and a non-database RPC. We fix this with Khedra, a daemon for indexing and monitoring, and the Unchained Index, a sharded, IPFS-pinned data store delivering “everything that ever happened” to any address. Imagine perfect transactional histories, reconciled every 12 seconds, without Etherscan snooping. Our SDK empowers devs to build privacy-first apps, like a bulletin board for your wallet, not Zuck’s.
Join me to see trueblocks-browse in action, showing how local-first infra makes Ethereum uncensorable again. Learn why the RPC isn’t enough and how our open-source stack (GitHub: TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core) lets you run a node on your laptop. This is cypherpunk rebellion with code—fast, private, and for the sheeple. Let’s build a Web3 that doesn’t sell out. Takeaways: Run your own node, query with our SDK, and join our Discord to re-decentralize Ethereum. Live Long and Decentralize!

Its focus on intuitive, user-friendly dApps aligns with Futurllama’s usability mission, making Web3 accessible while staying true to Ethereum’s permissionless ethos.                                                                                           |
