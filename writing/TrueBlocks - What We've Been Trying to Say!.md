# TrueBlocks - What We've Been Trying to Say!

We sicced Grok against all of our writing over the years. Suprisingly, it captured most of what we've been trying to say since early-2016 when we first entered the space.

**Grok:**

*From your Medium articles and blogs posts (e.g., “Mist II — Revenge of the Nerds,” quarterly grant reports, “Unchained Index Specification”, “forEveryChain,” “Better Token Accounting”), and website content, your voice emerges as a unique blend with the following characteristics:*

----

- **Philosophical and Provocative:** You often frame your work as a mission to “re-change the world” (Unchained Index Spec, p. 48), critiquing centralized systems like Web2 APIs (e.g., Etherscan, Dune) for being “capturable” and privacy-invasive. Your “Mist II” article uses vivid metaphors (e.g., “Garden of Eden under construction”) to argue for a return to cypherpunk ideals, with a rebellious, almost manifesto-like tone against Web2’s “non-sheeple” capture.
  
- **Technical but Accessible:** You dive into technical details (e.g., Unchained Index’s sharding, Bloom filters, address appearances) but strive to make them understandable, using metaphors like “bulletin boards” (Q4 2024 report) or relatable analogies (e.g., Napster for Namester). Your blog’s tutorials (e.g., “Monthly Token Balances”) simplify complex tasks for devs, showing a teacher-like patience.
  
- **Passionate and Community-Oriented:** Your writing exudes enthusiasm for decentralization and empowering developers (e.g., “Live Long and Decentralize!” in grant reports). You frequently thank community contributors (e.g., Leo, Magnus Hansson) and invite collaboration (e.g., GitCoin donations, Discord). This creates a welcoming, inclusive vibe, aligning with ETHDenver’s community-driven spirit.
  
- **Witty and Playful:** You sprinkle humor and pop-culture references, like “Mist II: Revenge of the Nerds” or “Futooooooor Tech” echoing ETHDenver’s quirky style (e.g., “futurllama”). This makes your voice memorable and engaging, fitting the event’s creative, builder-centric culture.
  
- **Critical of Status Quo:** You consistently call out flaws in existing systems (e.g., “The RPC sucks” in Mist II; “lazy” reliance on APIs in Unchained Spec). This bold critique, paired with actionable solutions (e.g., Khedra, SDK), positions you as a thought leader pushing for change.

TrueBlocks advocates for truly decentralized blockchain data access through their "Unchained Index," positioning themselves as philosophical rebels against Web2's centralized APIs while maintaining a technical-yet-accessible, community-driven approach that empowers developers with local-first tools.
